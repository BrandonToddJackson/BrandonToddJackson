👋 Hi, I'm Brandon Todd Jackson — an AI Systems Architect and Fractional AI Executive.

🚀 Building Production-Ready AI Systems

I design, build, and deploy enterprise-scale AI systems that generate measurable ROI—not pilots that never make it to production. As a Fractional AI Executive, I work WITH companies to architect scalable solutions, teaching teams as we build. You get a working system AND the knowledge to maintain, extend, and build more systems yourself.

💼 Enterprise Experience & Results

• Former VP Product at JPMorgan Chase & Co., building AI data products for the financial sector
• Built custom ML pricing solutions used by Best Buy, Dollar General, Sally Beauty, PetSmart, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Academy Sports
• Delivered measurable outcomes: $1.5M recovered revenue, $80K new revenue in 40 days, 70% reduction in manual workflows, systems that scale 10x without redesign
• Migrated enterprise databases 3 months ahead of schedule for FedEx and Coyote Logistics

🏗️ Architecture-First Approach

10+ years combining data strategy, MLOps, and infrastructure design with first-principles thinking. I build only what's necessary—systems prioritizing scalability, cost-efficiency, and measurable ROI from day one. Rather than leaving you with a plan or black box, I build WITH you, ensuring your team can own, maintain, and extend the architecture independently.
